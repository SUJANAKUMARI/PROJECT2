# Project Title

DATA ACQUISITION AND DATA WRANGLING

## Dependencies

Downloads: Jupyter Notebook. 

Libraries to be imported: 

1.  Pandas.
2.  Numpy.
3.  Matplotlib.
4.  SNS.

## Features

DATA ACQUISITION:  Identify and obtain access to the data within your sources.

DATA WRANGLING:  Data wrangling deals with the below functionalities:
1.  Data exploration:  The data is studied, analyzed and understood by visualizing representations of data.
2. Dealing with missing values:  Most of the datasets having a vast amount of data contain missing values of NaN, they are needed to be taken care of by replacing them with the mean, mode, or simply dropping the rowing a NaN value.
3. Reshaping data:  In this process, data is manipulated according to the requirements, where new data can be added or pre-existing data can be modified.
4. Filtering data:  Sometimes datasets are comprised of unwanted rows and columns which are required to be removed or filtered.
5. Other:  After dealing with the raw dataset with the above functionalities we get an efficient dataset as per our requirements and then it can used for a required purpose like data analysing, machine learning, data visualisation, model training, etc.

## Methodology

LOADING THE DATASETS (i.e.,  Dataset_1, Dataset_2 and Dataset_3) 

LOADING THE LIBRARIES: Include pandas, numpy, sns, matplotlib, scipy etc.

TECHNICAL SKILLS INVOLVED:  Data Acquisition and Data Wrangling of the dataset_1, dataset_2 and dataset_3.  Merging of the dataset_1 and dataset_2 and working on central tendency.  Concatenating the merged dataset 1 and 2 with dataset_3

PLATFORM:  Codes are executed and run in Jupyter Notebook.

## FINAL OUTPUT

The comparison box plots for each columns in which the outliers were present to check to what extent the outliers were removed through the Interquartile range method.

Below are the images of the outputs of the comparison Box plots:

## Skewness

After outlier removal checking the skewness of the cleaned dataframe and it shows that almost all the columns are normally distributed and we can also see the comparatively the skewness is reduced after removing the outliers.  Below are the screenshots of skewness calculated before and after removal ofoutliers.

##Correlation

A correlation heatmap is a graphical tool that displays the correlation between the variables as a color-coded matrix.   Itâ€™s like a color chart that shows us how closely related different variables are.  Below is the image of the correlation heatmap of the cleaned dataset df2_cleaned.
